After 9 years at [Capital One](https://capitalone.co.uk/) working in an Operations role i've slowly been realising my dream of becoming a software developer. I have been provided with a huge oppurtunity to take part in a pilot whereby 3 associates including myself would complete a coding bootcamp provided by [CodeNation](https://wearecodenation.com/). This eventually leading to having the required skills to begin a 9 month placement in one of Capital One's very own Tech teams.
